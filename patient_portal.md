Patient portal is a secured page which is available for the patients. Each patient can view their own information after logging in. In this their details like diagnosis, dates, treatment etc should be shown. 

This page will allow patient to :
1. Get a consolidated view of all questionnaires they have responded to along with the dates. 
2. Show a prominent link for the Complete questionnaire page. 
3. Show the list of questionnaires currently available for them. 
4. Show plots of item responses (as in the prom_review) but without any filters and aggregation. Each item response plot should be in a card and there should be a way to select a specific set of items to display. 
5. Color scheme followed in the plot should be same as that of the prom_review page.
